# About

Cellular was built with a simple goal in mind - to allow your Mac to connect to your phone's mobile hotspot seamlessly, as if your Mac has cellular data connectivity.

Cellular is a utility that brings your Mac and your Android phone closer together. When your Mac goes out of range of known Wi-Fi networks, Cellular seamlessly switches your Mac's internet connection to your phone's hotspot. And when you go in range of your trusted networks, Cellular intelligently turns off your phone's hotspot and reconnects you to the trusted network, saving energy while providing ultimate convenience.

# Features

- Connect to mobile hotspot seamlessly when other Wi-Fi networks are not available
- Disconnect from mobile hotspot automatically when computer is put to sleep
- Disconnect from mobile hotspot automatically when trusted Wi-Fi networks are available
- View phone information such as cell signal strength, network type and battery level from the menu bar of your Mac
- Turn off hotspot automatically when phone battery is below a set limit
